# drbreaktime
A clone of a popular puzzle game

To make this work, you'll need to pull jfpiotrowski/drbreaktime-board and build it. This package depends on that package and I haven't made the imports work yet.

## Playing the game

The game requires a controller to run and is designed to work with XBOX 360/XBONE controllers on Windows. I use dongles for both.
Any controller might work but I make no guarantees that the buttons make sense.

To run the game, do the following:

* at the title screen, press start
* at the blank screen, press start to get a slot
    * Press up/down to change level and A to select the level
    * Up to 4 can play right now

To play the game, use A/X to rotate and the D-pad to move the piece. Down moves it down. Holding left/right is not implemented yet, you have to use discrete pushes. Clear the virii.

At the end screen, press start to start a new game or select to return to title. That's it.

Stuff to add:
* Resizing
* Sounds
* Multi-game rounds
* Single player time attack
* More sarcasm
* Non-crap graphics
